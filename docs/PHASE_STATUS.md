LATEST PHASE: Phase 2B transactional hold implementation; see PHASE_2B_REPORT.md for capacity locking, retry and expiry policy. Next development scope is Phase 2C orders/items. Earlier status paragraphs are historical.

LATEST: Phase 2A availability/pricing implemented. 81 tests pass; lint/typecheck/build pass (build rerun after transient Windows EBUSY). See PHASE_2A_REPORT.md and BOOKING_AVAILABILITY_V1.md. Next: Phase 2B transactional holds. Earlier scope notes below are historical.

CURRENT ACCEPTANCE: Phase 1 foundations PASS. Hosted proxy cookie refresh, rejected-refresh session removal and successful idempotent privileged RPC are verified; see PHASE_1_PLATFORM_ACCEPTANCE.md. Earlier progress notes below are historical and superseded. Next scope: Phase 2A availability/pricing contract. No Phase 2 implementation yet.

Hosted identity update: real sign-in, refresh-token exchange, cross-operator reads, direct write denial, protected RPC denial and membership deactivation pass against the development project. Synthetic records were removed. Next.js cookie/expired-session integration remains pending; Phase 1 audit stays PARTIAL. See scripts/verify-supabase-development.mjs and SUPABASE_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md.

Supabase setup update: fresh development project `ybngoppqqiohcduojfyg` linked; all five migrations applied and remote history verified. Hosted database/API and Auth endpoint smoke checks pass. Real user/session and authenticated tenant-isolation checks remain pending. See SUPABASE_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md.

Active scope: Phase 1G fixtures complete; Phase 1H local checks pass (74 tests, lint, typecheck, build). Phase 1 audit is PARTIAL pending real Supabase Auth/PostgREST integration. Native PostgreSQL concurrency is verified for existing hold and event/audit primitives. No checkpoint or Phase 2 work yet. See PHASE_1_AUDIT.md and DECISIONS.md. No legacy imports or production changes.
